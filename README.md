Starbound utilities for Python
==============================

This is a library to parse Starbound's file formats which are used to
store worlds, player characters, assets, etc.

Feel free to contribute either via submitting pull requests or writing
up issues with suggestions and/or bugs.


File & data formats
-------------------

Check out [FORMATS.md](./FORMATS.md) for technical information on
Starbound's file and data formats.


Command line utilities
----------------------

### Extracting `.pak` files

You can use the `export.py` script to extract all the files in a `.pak`
(or `.modpak`) file.

Example:

```bash
./export.py -d assets /Starbound/assets/packed.pak
```

### Getting world info

If you want information about a region in a world (planet or ship), you
can use the `region.py` script. For example, here's how to pretty print
the tiles in a region:

```bash
$ ./region.py /Starbound/storage/universe/-382912739_-582615456_-73870035_3.world
World size:        3000×2000
Spawn point:       (1224.0, 676.0)
Outputting region: (37, 21)
Outputting value:  foreground_material
```

Outputs something like this:

If you don't provide X and Y coordinates after the path, it will
default to the region that the spawn point is in.

You can also output specific tile values (instead of the foreground)
using `--value-index` (or `-v`):

```bash
$ ./region.py --value-index=12 /Starbound/storage/universe/-382912739_-582615456_-73870035_3.world 69 27
World size:        3000×2000
Spawn point:       (1224.0, 676.0)
Outputting region: (69, 27)
Outputting value:  liquid_pressure
```

Outputs something like this:

And here's how to print the entities in a region:

```bash
$ ./region.py --entities /Starbound/storage/universe/-382912739_-582615456_-73870035_3.world 69 27
World size:        3000×2000
Spawn point:       (1224.0, 676.0)
Outputting region: (69, 27)

      },
      "scriptStorage": {},
...
```


Using the Python package
------------------------

The Python package lets you read data from Starbound's various file
formats. The classes and functions expect file objects to read from.

You can use the `mmap` package to improve performance for large files,
such as `packed.pak` and world files.

### Example: Reading a player file

Here's how to print the name of a player:

```python
import starbound

with open('player/11475cedd80ead373c19a91de2e2c4d3.player', 'rb') as fh:
  player = starbound.read_sbvj01(fh)
  print('Hello, {}!'.format(player.data['identity']['name']))
```

### Example: World files

In the following example the `mmap` package is used for faster access:

```python
import mmap, starbound

with open('universe/43619853_198908799_-9440367_6_3.world', 'rb') as fh:
  mm = mmap.mmap(fh.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ)

  world = starbound.World(mm)
  world.read_metadata()

  print('World size: {}×{}'.format(world.width, world.height))
  x, y = world.metadata['playerStart']
  print('Player spawns at ({}, {})'.format(x, y))

  # Regions consist of 32×32 tiles.
  rx, ry = x // 32, y // 32
  print('An entity: {}'.format(world.get_entities(rx, ry)[0]))
```

### Example: Getting assets from `packed.pak`

Starbound keeps most of the assets (images, configuration files,
dungeons, etc.) in a file called `packed.pak`. This file uses a special
format which can be read by py-starbound, as you can see below.

```python
import starbound

with open('assets/packed.pak', 'rb') as fh:
  package = starbound.SBAsset6(fh)

  # Print the contents of a file in the asset package.
  print(package.get('/lighting.config'))
```

### Example: Modifying Starbound files

Currently, only the SBVJ01 file format can be written by py-starbound.
This means player files, client context files, and the statistics file.

Here's an example that renames a player (WARNING: Always back up files
before writing to them!):

```python
import starbound

with open('player/420ed511f83b3760dead42a173339b3e.player', 'r+b') as fh:
  player = starbound.read_sbvj01(fh)

  old_name = player.data['identity']['name']
  new_name = old_name.encode('rot13')
  player.data['identity']['name'] = new_name
  print('Updating name: {} -> {}'.format(old_name, new_name))

  # Go back to the beginning of the file and write the updated data.
  fh.seek(0)
  starbound.write_sbvj01(fh, player)
  # If the file got shorter, truncate away the remaining content.
  fh.truncate()
```
